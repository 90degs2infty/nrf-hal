# Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency framework demo - Concurrency Framework

Many of the demos in this project use RTIC and demonstrate its capabilities in more detail but this is a bare-bones default template for you to build off. RTIC is not unique to the nRF series but very useful for a program that requires concurrency. Unfortunately, this demo does not appear to use rtt for logging so it crashes when used with probe-run. However, it will work with other debuggers. See other demos for rtt logging setup.
